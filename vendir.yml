# When adding a helm chart to our set of components:
# 1. Find the chart you need from https://hub.helm.sh/charts/stable
# 2. Note the latest (or desired) version from the "Chart Versions" section on the right.
# 3. Navigate to the corresponding directory of https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable
# 4. Look at the history or blame log of the Chart.yaml file to find when the version was bumped to the version you found earlier.
# 5. The SHA of the commit that bumped the version will be the SHA you use as the 'ref' of the git section below.
